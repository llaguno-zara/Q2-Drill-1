                <br>
                <p>You must prepare AT LEAST one gallon of water per person with a minimum of 3 days, along with ready-to-eat or easy to prepare food. Examples such as canned food, energy/protein bars, and nutritious snacks.</p>

                <br>
                <p>We must always have a First Aid Kit prepared. The items that are a must in a First Aid Kit are different sized bandages, betadine, antiseptic wipes, sterile gauze, isopropyl alcohol, and oral thermometer.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Packing a flashlight with batteries is useful for when there are power outages as they are a good source of light. This allows us to see in the dark and see things more clearly.</p>

                <h3>Extra Clothes</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Incase of emergencies, like getting wet from the rain, a pair of extra clothes can be useful. In unlikely situations where you might stay longer at the evacuation center, it is better to be sure to have clothes packed.</p>
